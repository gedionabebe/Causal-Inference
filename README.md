## Overview
The aim of this project is to use causal inference to help our client optimize placement of pilots. Our client for this project is is Gokada - the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. Gokada has completed more than a million deliveries in less than a year, with a fleet of over 1200 riders.

Gokada has tasked us to work on its data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, our solution will help Gokada business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.
